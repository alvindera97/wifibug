### Environment Set Up
You will need the following software installed:
- Python (version 3.10 >=, <3.20)
- Google Chrome Browser **& corresponding webdriver** (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/get-started) — If you use another browser, then you'll need to install the corresponding webdriver for the browser's version. 
- Install pre-commit hooks:
  ```bash
pre-commit install
```


You'll need to pip install all project dependencies, **(however I would recommend you use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))**: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
